_ How to install Vodstok on a server _


1. Copy the whole content of www/ in a dedicated place on your server filesystem
2. Chmod the 'chunks' and 'endpoints' directories to make it writeable (770 or 700, at least)
3. Configure the config.inc.php file and set up the maximum amount of space your Vodstok will provide (define QUOTA_MB, size in MB)
4. Configure your Vodstok client to use your new Vodstok endpoint


_ How to use the Vodstok client _

Vodstok file sharing system is based on storage servers, installed on many web servers. You have to register them (or they will if you try to download a file through Vodstok) before being able to upload a file. This can be done by using the -a option:

$ ./vodstok -a http://vodstok.server.com/vodstok-directory/

You can remove an server with the -r option, or list the registered ones with the -l option. Be careful, the server url MUST be terminated with a trailing '/'.

It is strongly recommended to add other servers, to publish yours and update your servers list:

$ ./vodstok -p http://vodstok.server.com/vodstok-directory/
$ ./vodstok -u

If you want to upload a file, juste be sure that at least one server is registered and use this syntax:

$ ./vodstok [filename]

As a result, a link will be provided.
You can share this link through IRC, MSN, Skype or via a website. 

To download a file given a link:

$ ./vodstok [link]

And that's it, if the file is available the Vodstok client will get it and create it in the current directory. You can specify another directory with the -w option.
